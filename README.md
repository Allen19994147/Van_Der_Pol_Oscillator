# Van_Der_Pol_Oscillator # Synchronizaiton

In this task, the dynamic of a Van Der Pol Oscillator is studied.

In Observer_for_VDP_Oscillator.slx file, an observer is designed to estimate its velocity based on its position measurement using contraction analysis.

In VDP_Oscillator_syn.slx file, a controller is designed to synchronize two Van Der Pol Oscillators based on the velocity estimation.
