# Van_Der_Pol_Oscillator # Synchronizaiton

In this task, the dynamic of a Van Der Pol Oscillator is studied.

An observer is designed to estimate its velocity based on its position measurement using contraction analysis.

A controller is designed to synchronize two Van Der Pol Oscillators based on velocity estimation.
